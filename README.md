# E-Harkness

I attended high school at King's Academy, where the Harkness Method is most often used for teaching. In a nutshell, it's a classroom model whereby the students and teacher sit around an oval table the whole time--no rows or seats. These discussions require skill and practice because they are not regulated by a teacher, so they are often documented in full detail to find weaknesses and improve.

All teachers nowadays still use a sheet of paper to map out and annotate the discussion as shown here:
